    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p> 
        We are two innovative Babson students who are passionate about using coding to solve real-world challenges. Our Problem Solving Software Design class has inspired us to create a bot that bridges communication gaps. Our inspiration for this project came from a moment of realization - that even in this era of advanced technology, we often find ourselves struggling to communicate effectively in crucial situations like meetings, where one is unable to hear important voice messages or send them back. Our solution empowers individuals to communicate more effectively in an efficient and effective way, revolutionizing communication.
