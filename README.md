# **Project Proposal**

## *The Big Idea*
### Prior to beginning this project, we consulted with family members and friends to identify a real-life problem that needed solving. Although their responses were varied, most mentioned the app 'Telegram', which is widely used for communication in all over the world. We discovered that people often struggle to use Telegram appropriately in formal settings. The idea that came up was to create a Telegram Bot that can convert text messages into voice messages, and vice versa. This concept is particularly useful in situations where it is more efficient or appropriate to express thoughts or ideas verbally, or when it is not possible to listen to a message but reading it would work better. For example, in important gatherings or meetings. 

## *Learning Objectives*
### Regarding our objectives, we are looking forward to growing our knowledge of utilizing AI to solve real-world issues, particularly in our daily lives. We aspire to gain hands-on experience in implementing AI solutions within the messaging platform Telegram. This involves exploring AI algorithms, techniques, and tools relevant to voice message conversion. We see this project as an opportunity to utilize the knowledge we have acquired in Python throughout this semester. 

## *Implementation Plan*
### During our class on session 20, we learned about utilizing OpenAI's API via HTTPS requests. Exploring the capabilities of this API, I discovered a feature titled 'Generates audio from inputted text' available at: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech . Additionally, I came across an option called 'Represents a transcription response returned by the model, based on the provided input' at: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text. This could potentially help us in implementing the speech-to-text functionality. Furthermore, we looked into resources on Google to learn how to send messages using Python, to start looking at how we could automate messages in telegram using Python. Several articles provided guidance on this, such as: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-using-python/

## *Project Schedule*
+ Week #1 (April 1st):  Define the project idea based on initial feedback. Conduct thorough research on libraries, frameworks, and resources essential for project execution. Finalize and submit the project proposal, outlining the main objectives, MVP, and stretch goals.  

+ Week #2 (April 8th): Begin implementing OpenAI's API for text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities. Familiarize myself with the API documentation and start coding the telegram Bot.  

+ Week #3 (April 15th): Start the development of the project website. Design the visual elements and layout, ensuring that is an easy to understand interface. Test the integration of OpenAI's API with the telegram Bot features. Also, Debug any issues encountered during testing. 

+ Week #4 (April 22nd , due date 27th): Review all code to identify areas for improvement. Conduct testing to ensure all features function as intended. I will seek feedback from peers and professor to gather insights for further improvement. 

## *Risks and Limitations*
### We believe that the most significant threat for this project’s success is the accuracy and reliability of natural language processing (NLP) models employed for text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion. These are critical for delivering accurate results: Inaccuracies, misinterpretations, or limitations in NLP algorithms would not make the telegram Bot work.  

## *Additional Course Content*
### For our project, topics such as Flask and HTML are very important, particularly for the development of the project's website. Flask provides the framework necessary for building web applications, while HTML serves as the language for structuring the web page and presenting the content in an easy-to-understand way. Also, API integration skills are crucial, as we aspire to incorporate OpenAI’s API into the telegram Bot. Another important topic is debugging techniques, these are essential for identifying and resolving potential issues within the project's code. Effective debugging helps to improve the operation of the telegram Bot, minimizing disruptions and optimizing performance throughout its development.
